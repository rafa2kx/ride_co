- Display a list of nearby stores that have the product in stock.
- Map integration for visual representation.
- Filter options (distance, store ratings, price range).

### Technical Considerations
- Requires API keys and rate limit handling.
- Store caching mechanisms for reducing API calls.
- Privacy considerations for handling user location data.
